# ðŸ§  Programmazione2-2025 - Exam Exercises Repository

> A curated collection of exercises, theory notes and full exam-style solutions for *Programmazione 2*.  
> Includes C basics, data structures (trees, graphs, linked lists), and ready-to-run exam proofs in separate branches.

---

## ðŸš€ Quick overview

- **Language:** C++ (mostly, but with some C reeeferences), with notes & code for algorithms and datastructures.  
- **Main branch (`main`)** â€” bite-sized exercises, theory, and helpers (perfect for studying).  
- **Exam branches (`exam-...`)** â€” complete, working exam solutions (each exam attempt in its own branch).  
- Well-suited for study, revision and creating your personal cheat-sheet for the course.

## ðŸ“š What you'll find

### C basics
- Input/output, `scanf`/`printf`, string handling, dynamic allocation (`malloc`/`free`), pointer exercises.
- Practical small programs with explained solutions and pitfalls.

### Linked lists (singly & doubly)
- Create, insert, delete, search, reverse list, merge lists.
- Example implementations + testcases.

### Trees
- Binary tree operations, Binary Search Tree (insert/search/delete), recursive & iterative traversals, height/balance checks.

### Graphs
- Representations (adjacency list/matrix), BFS, DFS, connectivity, topological sort, Dijkstra (where applicable).
- Complexity notes and edge-case discussion (directed vs undirected).

### Exam-style branches
- Branches named like `prova-DD-MM-YYYY`  contain full, functioning exam solutions (compilable and runnable).
- Use them to practice under real exam constraints or to study full solved questions.

## Little reminder
- For compiling the program, go to `Terminal > Run build task` (Esegui attivitÃ  di compilazione)
- To run the program, create a new terminal and write this command: `./name_executable_file`

## Useful commands
- `gcc executable_file file.c`  âž¡  To compile a file: it is possible to add some options
- `make (nmake on Windows)`     âž¡   To run a Makefile
